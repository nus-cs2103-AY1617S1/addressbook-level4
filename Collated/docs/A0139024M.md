## 0. Introduction 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello new developer! We are pleased to welcome you into our team and we hope that you will enjoy your time working with us. DoMePlease is a reliable task management application that accepts 3 kinds of tasks, namely: floating tasks, deadlines and events. This application caters to users who prefer using the command-line interface. Our Developer Guide introduces you to our code base so that you can dive straight into code without much lead-time. The documents listed provide details about how to extend our application using Java's various APIs. 

Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away
--Antoine de Saint-Exupery

## 1. Setting up

#### 1.1 Prerequisites

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1.1.1</b> **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

      Having any Java 8 version is not enough.
      This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1.1.2</b> **Eclipse** IDE <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1.1.3</b> **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious)) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1.1.4</b> **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace <br>


#### 1.2 Importing the project into Eclipse

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1.2.1</b> Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1.2.2</b> Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given 
   in the prerequisites above) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1.2.3</b> Click `File` > `Import` <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1.2.4</b> Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next` <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1.2.5</b> Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1.2.6</b> Click `Finish` <br>

      If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
      Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
      If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

## 2. Design

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br><br>

>The **Architecture Diagram** given above explains the high-level design of the App. <br>
 Given below is a quick overview of each component. <br>
 
### 2.1 Main Component
 
 `Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for

    At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
    At shut down: Shuts down the components and invoke clean up method where necessary.

### 2.2 Common Component

`Commons` represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play an important role at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log files.
* Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commands` package. 

The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#2-3-ui-component) : The UI of tha App.
* [**`Logic`**](#2-4-logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](2-5-model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](2-6storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ an interface with the same name as the Component. `Logic.java`
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class e.g. `LogicManager.java`

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 3`.

<img src="images\SDforDeletePerson.png" width="800">

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ModelChangedEvent` when the model is changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>
<img src="images\SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png" width="800">

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 2.3 UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagramTD.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `DatedTaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `UndatedTaskListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow` inherits from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raises from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

### 2.4 Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`

### 2.5 Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagramTD.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences
* Stores DoMePlease data
* Exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

### 2.6 Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagramTD.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the DoMePlease data in xml format and read it back.

## 3. Implementation

### 3.1 Logging

We are using `java.util.logging.Logger` as our logger, and `LogsCenter` is used to manage the logging levels 
of loggers and handlers (for output of log messages)

    - The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file 
      (See [Configuration](#3-2-configuration))
    - The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to 
      the specified logging level
    - Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and `.log`

**Logging Levels**

* SEVERE 
 
     Critical use case affected, which may possibly cause the termination of the application

* WARNING

    Can continue, but with caution

* INFO

    Information important for the application's purpose e.g. update to local model/request sent to cloud
    Information that the layman user can understand

* FINE

    Used for superficial debugging purposes to pinpoint components that the fault/bug is likely to arise from
    Should include more detailed information as compared to `INFO` i.e. log useful information!
    e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### 3.2 Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`):


## 4. Testing

**In Eclipse**: 
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests
  as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose 
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose 
  to run as a JUnit test.
  
**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle. 

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

> **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. 
   These are in the `guitests` package.  
       
> **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include: <br>

    1 Unit tests targeting the lowest level methods/classes. e.g. `seedu.address.commons.UrlUtilTest`
    2 Integration tests that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
    3 Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as  how the are connected together. e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`
  
**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the ([TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX)) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. 
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br> <br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
  
## 5. Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

## 6. Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
    1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
    2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
    3. [Crete a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file your created.
   
## 7. Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third party libraries. For example, DoMePlease depends on the 
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>

    1. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
    2. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

## 1. Introduction 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever felt like there are too many tasks to do, and you are unable to remember all of them? Or feel that your calendar is overflowing with sticky notes on the tasks to be done each day? Have no fear, as our all-in-one task management application, DoMePlease, is here to save your day!

DoMePlease manages the different types of tasks that you will encounter in your daily life, be it a deadline for submission, or even a date with your significant other, this application can show you what all the tasks you have in a month in one glance, or even a list of tasks for a specific day. DoMePlease also manages your list of ad-hoc tasks, which are non-dated tasks such as "Read the new Harry Potter book!", and displays them beautifully and neatly at the side of the application, so you can refer to them any time you have some free time.

Love typing? You will love DoMePlease, as you only need to use the keyboard to type simple commands to manage your tasks.
