### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
*Figure 1: Architecture Diagram*

The **_Architecture Diagram_** *(figure 1)* explains the high-level design of the App.
A quick overview of each component is given below:

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/teamfour/tasc/MainApp.java). It has two main responsibilities:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.
<br><br>

The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : Allows users to interact with the program.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : Executes commands.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from and writes data to the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name.
* exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.
<br><br>

For example, the **`Logic`** component (see the class diagram in *figure 2* below) defines its API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
*Figure 2: Class Diagram of Logic component*
<br><br>

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact when the user issues the
command `delete 1`.

<img src="images\SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800"><br>
*Figure 3: Sequence Diagram of user interaction*

>Notice how the **`Model`** simply raises a `TaskListChangedEvent` when the TaSc data are changed,
 instead of asking the **`Storage`** to save the updates to the hard disk.

<br><br>
The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>

<img src="images\SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800"><br>
*Figure 4: Sequence Diagram of EventsCenter*

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the **`Storage`** and **`UI`** without **`Model`** having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct
  coupling between components.

The next sections give more details of each component.

### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
*Figure 7: Class Diagram of Logic component*

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/teamfour/tasc/logic/Logic.java)

 **`Logic`** uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`. The command execution can affect the **`Model`** (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
 The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
<br><br>

Given below *(figure 8)* is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the **`Logic`** component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>

<img src="images/DeletePersonSdForLogic.png" width="800"><br>
*Figure 8: Sequence Diagram for interactions in Logic*
<br><br>

**`Logic` Interface:**

The `Logic` interface allows you to request for any logic-related operation, such as parsing and executing commands, without having to know anything about the implementation of the `LogicManager` class.

**Notable APIs**

Return type | Method and Description
----------- | ----------------------
CommandResult() | `execute(String commandText)`: Identifies and executes the command found in the input string `commandText`.
ObservableList() | `getFilteredTaskList()`: Retrieves the filtered task list from the **`Model`** component.
<br>

**`Logic Manager` Class:**

The `Logic Manager` class implements the **`Logic`** interface, and provides all the services and functionality
specifed in the **`Logic`** interface. It executes the command in the input string passed from the **`UI`** component. First, it passes the command string to the `Parser` class to get a `Command` object. Then, it executes the `Command` to produce a `CommandResult`. This `CommandResult` is then passed back to the **`UI`** component.

Other components should reference this class indirectly by using the `Logic` interface. You should not directly use this class outside the **`Logic`** component.
<br><br>

**`Parser` Class:**

The `Parser` class parses the given input string and returns the corresponding `Command`. It uses predefined keywords to identify which `Command` to return, and to extract the arguments relevant to the `Command`. `Parser` then calls the constructor for the identified `Command`, and passes in the extracted arguments.
<br><br>

**`Command` Class:**

The `Command` class takes input arguments from the `Parser`class, and produces a `CommandResult` based on the input. There are multiple `Command` subclasses, which takes different input parameters and produces different `CommandResult`s. The **`Logic`** class executes `Command`s to change the data in **`Model`** according to the command type and input arguments.

### Common classes

The `teamfour.tasc.commons` package contains classes used by multiple components.

**`ComponentManager` Class:**

The `ComponentManager` class serves as the base class for the various Manager classes, like `ModelManager` and `LogicManager`. It is responsible for registering the Managers' event handlers in `EventsCenter`.

**`Config` Class:**

The `Config` class stores various configuration values used by the app, such as the file path of the storage file and logging levels.

**`EventsCenter` Class:**

The `EventsCenter` class manages the event dispatching of the app. It is responsible for regitering event `Handler`s to the `EventBus`, and posting events to the `EventBus`.

**`GuiSettings` Class:**

The `GuiSettings` class contains various GUI settings, such as the size and location of the GUI window.

**`LogsCenter` Class**

The `LogsCenter` class configures and manages loggers and handlers. It contains settings such as the logging level and the size of the log file generated by the app.

#### Todoist

Strengths:

* 'One shot approach' - Can enter tasks and details in one typed in command
* Typed in command resembles natural language
* Supports recurring tasks
* Allows postponement of tasks
* Allows entering tasks that need to be done before/after/without a specific date/time
* Syncs when online, but can be used offline too
* Multiplatform (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, browser extensions - Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
* Allows searching for tasks
* Can set priorities for tasks

Weaknesses:

* Does not help find suitable slot to schedule task
* Marking item as done simply deletes it
* Cannot 'block' or 'release' multiple slots when timing is uncertain
* Mouse required for most actions, only task creation uses the keyboard

Summary:

Does not store completed tasks, and still requires mouse for most actions

Our Program:

We will include completion status for all tasks. All commands will be able to be executed by typing
them through the command box.

## Introduction

Organize your tasks with just a *single* line of command.

Need to add, delete or update a task? *One line* is all that it needs.<br>
Want to list, search or filter your tasks? *One line* is all that it takes.

Many of us lead busy lives, with never ending streams of tasks often weighing on our minds. We understand it all too well, and we want to lessen that burden for you.

This is the motivation behind TaSc, our Task Scheduler with keyboard usability at its core. TaSc is quick, simple, and contains all the functionalities you need to plan and record your tasks.

Just type in your command, and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Let us handle the rest - you have more important things to do.

## Features

### Adding a new task/event: `add`

You can easily add a new task by giving it a name using the `add` command:

`add "A new task"`

> **Tip:**<br>
> Commands are not case-sensitive.

<br>
If your task is due on a certain date, you may provide a deadline by adding the `by` keyword:

`add "CS2101 homework" by 21 Oct 5pm`

> **Tip:**<br>
> Acceptable date formats: 18 Sep, 18 September, 18 Sep 2016, Sep 18 2016,
  Today, Monday<br>
> Acceptable time formats: 5pm, 5:01pm, 5:01:59pm, 17:00

<br>
Events can also be added easily by providing the period that it will happen
with the `from` and `to` keywords:

`add "CS2101 Meeting" from 24 Oct 3pm to 5pm`

<br>
Some events happen repeatly (for example, lectures are conducted every week).
You can specify a recurring task/event by using the `repeat` keywords:

`add "GET1006 Lecture" from Monday 8am to 10am repeat weekly 18`

> **Note:** <br>
> `repeat weekly 18` means that the lecture will take place for 18 weeks.<br>
> Acceptable recurrence patterns: daily, weekly, monthly

<br>
Finally, tags can be added to tasks for you to categorize them. For example,
you may choose to use tags as a way to prioritize or to classify tasks.

`add CS2101 Submission by 5 Nov tag "Very Important" tag "CS2101"`

<img src="images/Ui-Add.png" width="600"><br>
*Figure 3: The `add` command allows you to add a new task easily*
<br><br>

In general, you may use this format to add tasks with various parameters.<br>
`add NAME [by DEADLINE] [from START_TIME to END_TIME] [repeat PATTERN FREQUENCY] [tag TAG...]`

 * Words in lower case are the keywords for setting the task parameters (e.g. use "by" to set deadline for task)
 * Words in UPPER CASE are the parameters associated with the keyword. Replace the parameters with the information you want to set. (e.g. replace "DEADLINE" with "1 April" to set task deadline as 1 April)
 * Keywords and parameters surrounded by '[' and ']' are optional. (e.g. both "add project" and "add project by tomorrow" are valid commands)
 *Parameters followed by "..." can have multiple instances in one command. (e.g. "add project tag important tag work" will add a task with two tags, "important" and "work") 

<br>

### Finding tasks/events which match keywords: `find`

You don't have to remember every details of the tasks you added, just use the `find`
command which returns the list of tasks which partially match by their names, dates, types or tags.

To show tasks with names such as "Up**grad**e myself", or tags such as
"**Grad**ed":

`find grad`

To show your task named "**V0.0 Deliverables**" in **Sep**tember:

`find "V0.0 Deliverables" sep`

> **Note:**<br>
> Words enclosed in quotation marks `" "` use exact match and are case-sensitive.<br>
> The task list results are shown in an order which prioritizes the closest match, followed by completion status and date.

<br>
In general, you may use this format to find tasks using keywords.<br>
`find KEYWORD...`
<br>

```
###### \UserGuide.md
``` md
### Deleting a task/event: `delete`

Sometimes, instead of marking it as `complete`, you may want to clean up
your task list to save disk space on your computer.

`delete 3`

> **Caution:**<br>
> Tasks deleted cannot be recovered **after** you exit the application. If you
> wish to keep the details of the task, use `complete` instead.

<br>
In general, you may use this format to delete your tasks.
`delete INDEX`
<br>


### Clearing all data: `clear`

Same as `delete`, but deletes the entire list.

`clear`

> **Caution:**<br>
> Tasks deleted cannot be recovered **after** you exit the application. If you
> wish to keep the details of the task, use `complete` instead.

<br>

### Changing the view of the task list panel: `collapse` and `expand`

You might find that each task takes up too much in the task list panel, requiring you to scroll a lot to see all the tasks you have.
Or perhaps you prefer to see an overview of many tasks at one glance at the task list panel, compared to all the details of a just few tasks. In such cases, you can collapse the task list panel view by typing:

`collapse`

This will change the view from something like this: <br>
//TODO Attach screenshot

To this:<br>
//Todo Attach screenshot

If you want to see all the details of your tasks agains, type:

`expand`
<br><br>

```
