## Appendix D : Glossary

##### Mainstream OS

> Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X

## Appendix E : Product Survey

Google Keep : SWOT
> Google Keep is an easy to use note taking application. It allows users to create different kinds of notes for different purposes. It also has some sort of a checklist which mimics the basic function of a to-do application. The user can also set reminders for a list but not for a specific task.

> A noticeable point about Google Keep is that there is no other way than a list to view the to-dos. Probably this is because Google has other forms of to-dos tracking application and Keep is just meant to be a lightweight option for users who do not need that much functionality.

Wunderlist : SWOT

> Wunderlist is a web and mobile application that allows user to keep track of their tasks. It has a very nice UI where user can change the background image of the application. Wunderlist also allows users to categorise their tasks into different groups which helps with organisation. Furthermore the application will hide all completed tasks by default from the users so the users will only see those that remain to be done.

> Wunderlist is a great application but one issue is that it does not allot tasks to belong to more than one categories. Another problem is that wunderlist as the name suggest, only allows users to view their tasks in a linear list format.

Todoist : SWOT
> Todoist is a cross platform task management application, with access to over 10 different platforms and the ability to collaborate on tasks. There are also multiple categories to choose from to tag tasks for, and with a daily streak, it encourages people to keep up the habit of clearing existing tasks that have been taken down. With Karma Mode, it allows also for users to rack up enough tasks during the week and have 'off days' where they do not have to continuously do tasks to keep their streak up.

> One flaw with Todoist is that the projects, while doing a great job of categorising tasks, do not possess subproject hierarchy and thus would make complex projects hard to split downwards in an orderly fashion.

Priority Matrix : SWOT

> Priority Matrix is a powerful software application that helps individuals be more effective at managing their priorities. It is supported on a number of platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Android, and iOS. A unique feature of Priority Matrix is that it separates its UI into 4 quadrants (Critical and Immediate, Critical but not Immediate, Not Critical but Immediate, and Uncategorised) which organize tasks based on importance and urgency so that users can have better time management.

> One strength of Priority Matrix is that it offers a cloud-based synchronization of data, allowing for data management across multiple devices.

> One improvement for Priority Matrix is that it could make its UI more aesthetically pleasing.

Any.Do : SWOT

>Any.Do is a cross platform task managment application that categorises the tasks in terms of when they need to be done. The tasks can also be further categorised into custom categories that can also be shared with friends and family. The application has a very simple and intuitive UI with words of encouragement when tasks are cleared.

>However, the application does not provide the option to mark a task with a priority level. This means that it would be difficult the important tasks from the trivial tasks at a glance. Furthermore, tasks are not sorted in date order, tasks that are more recent may be pushed below tasks that are dated relatively later.
