<strong>Summary:</strong> We observed that these products have very good features, but we realise that none of these products have the specific combination of features that caters to our target audience. Therefore, we are incorporating some of the good features such as minimalistic interface and ability to sync with multiple computers while designing DearJim carefully to avoid the pitfalls found in these products, to make a targeted product for our intended audience.
