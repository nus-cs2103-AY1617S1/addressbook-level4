### Conventions

<br>
Refer to the table below to help you understand the conventions used in this guide. 

<br>

|Convention|Description|
|:---------|:----------|
|`highlight`|Words/phrases that can be entered into the command line are in `highlight`.|
|UPPER_CASE|Arguments for which you key in input are in UPPER CASE. Each word in a phrase is separated by an underscore.|
|[ ]|Arguments in square brackets are optional.|
|(x \| y \| z)|Alternative keywords are grouped in brackets and separated by vertical bars.|
|[x \| y \| z]|Optional alternative keywords are grouped in square brackets and separated by vertical bars.|
|...|An ellipsis after an argument indicates that you may enter more arguments of the same type.|

<br>
You may refer to the following to see how the command format for the `delete-alias | remove-alias` command should be interpreted.

### Date and time formats

<br>
For `add (deadline | dl)`, `add (someday |sd)` and `list` commands, which would be mentioned in following segments, you will need to input a date and a time/time period. The table below lists the alternative date and time formats that you could use when entering these commands.

<br>

|Format|Example   |
|:-----|:---------|
|dd-mm-yy|25-12-16|
|dd-mm-yyyy|25-12-2016|
|yyyy-mm-dd|2016-12-25|
|dd-MMM-yy|25-dec-16|
|dd-MMM-yyyy|25-dec-2016|
|HH:mm|16:00|
|hh:mm am/pm|04:00 pm|
|hh am/pm|4 pm|

<br>
> Do note the following:
> - All dates and times are case-insensitive. For example, both `25-dec-16` and `25-DEC-16` are read the same. Likewise, this applies for `04:00 pm` and `04:00 PM`.
> - Hyphens separating the day, month and year in each date format can be replaced by spaces or forward slashes. For example, `25/12/16` in place of `25-12-16`.
> - For the hh:mm am/pm and hh am/ pm time formats, am/pm can be written with or without a space after the hour. For example, both `4 pm` and `4pm` are valid.
> - `today`, `tomorrow` and `next week` are keywords/keyphrases that will be registered as the date today, the date tomorrow and the date seven days from today respectively.
> - Date and time/ time period arguments can be entered in any order. For example, `add event 'dinner with wife' on 25-12-16 from 19:00 to 21:00pm` and `add event 'dinner with wife' from 19:00 to 21:00pm on 25-12-16` are registered the same.

<br>
### 3.7. Edit a task: `edit`
Accidentally entered wrong task information? Fret not! Use the `edit` command to change details of a task previously stored in the task manager.

Format: `edit INDEX ['NEW_NAME'] [from HH:MM DD-MM-YY] [to|by HH:MM DD-MM-YY] [done|not-done]`

> Do note the following:
> - Both the date and time must be specified if you are changing a time field.
> - The `from` and `to` edits are only valid for events.
> - The `by` edit is only valid for deadlines.
> - The date edit is valid for both events and deadlines, but not somedays.

Example:
* `list event` <br>
  `edit 1 'Hamlet at The Globe Theatre' from 08:00pm 23-11-2016 to 11:00pm 23-11-2016` <br>
  Edits the name of first task listed to 'Hamlet at The Globe Theatre' and its time period to 08:00pm-11:00pm on 23-11-2016.


<br>
### 3.8. Undo last operation: `undo`
It's very easy to make mistakes while typing. Instead of having to enter a command to reverse the effects of your last operation, you can simply type `undo`. <br>

Format: `undo`

> Do note that the `undo` command can be called repeatedly and will undo all operations up to
> and including the first operation performed upon starting the program.
> Calling `undo` subsequently will print an error to the console and no change to the data will occur.


<br>
### 3.9. Redo: `redo`
While undo reverses an action, redo reverses the last undo. <br>

Format: `redo`

> Do note that the `redo` command can be only be called immediately following an undo operation. 
> Redo can be called several times in a row to reverse a chain of undo commands.
