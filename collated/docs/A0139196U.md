## Introduction


Emeraldo is a simple app for users to manage their daily tasks, such as keeping track of deadlines and scheduling of events.
This app is catered for folks who can type fast and prefer typing over mouse/voice commands.
It is also a Java desktop application that has a GUI.
<br>
<br>
This guide describes the design and implementation of Emeraldo.
Through this guide, you will gain an understanding how Emeraldo works and how you can further contribute to its development.

#### Low Priority `*`


As a ... | I want to ... | so that ...
---------|--------------|------------
user | input my dates and days in any format that I want | it is easier for my usage.<br>
user | implement recurring tasks | I don't have to add the task every week.<br>
advanced user | use shorter versions of the commands | I can type in the commands faster.<br>
busy user | know what I can do next | I can fill up my free time slots.<br>
busy user | reserve time slots for one or more tasks that may not be confirmed | I know which to prioritise.
