#### Todoist: Strength and Weaknesses

> Todoist is a task management application, with access to over ten different platforms and the ability to collaborate on tasks. The application is straightforward and quick in providing the user with easy access to the important details of the to-do item. It also encourages people to keep up the habit of clearing existing tasks with its Karma Mode. 

> Moreover, its ease of use and its integration with other services are its true strength. It can integrate with the latest technologies such as Trello and Amazon Echo to keep every to-do item in a single place.

> However, one flaw with Todoist is that it does not possess any capabilities of having subproject hierarchy. Hence, it would make complex projects' task to be split among the team in an orderly fashion.
