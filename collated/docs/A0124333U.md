## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.  
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough.  
   This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
   
   Click [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) to download the latest Java version.
   
2. Download the latest `tars.jar` from the '[releases](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-F10-C1/main/releases)' tab.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TARS App.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. 
5. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it.  
   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window. 
6. Some example commands you can try:
   * **`ls`** : lists all tasks
   * **`add`**` Complete CS2103 Quiz 3 /dt 23/09/2016 /p h /t Quiz /t CS2103` : 
     adds a task `Complete CS2103 Quiz 3` to TARS.
   * **`del`**` 3` : deletes the 3rd task shown in TARS.
   * **`exit`** : exits the app
7. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command. 
8. NOTE
	- All text in `< >` are required fields whereas those in `[ ]` are optional.
	- `<INDEX>` refers to the index number of a task shown in the task list.
	- The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ... 
	- Priority options are: `h` for High, `m` for Medium, `l` for Low.


## Features
 
#### Adding a task : `add`
Adds a task to TARS  
Format: `<TASK_NAME> [/dt DATETIME] [/p PRIORITY] [/t TAG_NAME ...] [/r NUM_TIMES FREQUENCY]` 
 
> Support for events (i.e., has a start time and end time),  deadlines (tasks that have to be done before a specific deadline),  and floating tasks (tasks without specific times).
> 
> Parameters can be in any order.

Examples: 
* `add Meet John Doe /dt 26/09/2016 0900 to 26/09/2016 1030 /t catchup`
* `add Complete CS2103 Quiz /dt 23/09/2016 /p h /t Quiz /t CS2103, /r 13 EVERY WEEK`
* `add Floating Task`

```
###### /UserGuide.md
``` md
#### Changing data storage location : `cd`
Changes the directory of the TARS storage file.
Format: `cd <FILE_PATH>`

> Returns an error if the directory chosen is invalid. 
> 
> `<FILE_PATH>` must end with the file type extension, `.xml`

Examples:
* `cd C:\Users\John_Doe\Documents\tars.xml`

#### Clearing the data storage file : `clear`
Clears the whole To-Do List storage file.  
Format: `clear` 

```
###### /UserGuide.md
``` md
#### Confirming a reserved timeslot : `confirm`  
Confirms a dateTime for a reserved task and adds it to the task list.  
Format: `confirm <RSV_TASK_INDEX> <DATETIME_INDEX> [/p PRIORITY] [/t TAG_NAME ...]`

> Confirm the task of a specific `<RSV_TASK_INDEX>` at a dateTime of a specific `<DATETIME_INDEX>`. 
> 
> The `<RSV_TASK_INDEX>` refers to the index number shown in the reserved task list. 
> 
> The `<DATETIME_INDEX>` refers to the index number of the dateTime.

Examples:
* `confirm 3 2 /p l /t Tag` 

```
###### /UserGuide.md
``` md
#### Finding tasks : `find`
Finds all tasks containing a list of keywords (i.e. AND search).  
Two modes: Quick Search & Filter Search.  
Format:
* [Quick Search]: `find <KEYWORD> [KEYWORD ...]`  
* [Filter Search]: `find [/n NAME_KEYWORD ...] [/dt DATETIME] [/p PRIORITY] [/do] [/ud] [/t TAG_KEYWORD ...]`

> **Quick Search Mode**: Find tasks quickly by entering keywords that match what is displayed in the task list.
> 
> **Filter Search Mode**: Find tasks using task filters (i.e. /n, /p, /dt, /do, /ud, /t).
> 
> Use /n to filter tasks by task name.
> 
> Use /p to filter tasks by priority level.
> 
> Use /dt to filter tasks by date (in a date range).
> 
> Use /do to filter all done tasks (Cannot be used together with /ud).
> 
> Use /ud to filter all undone tasks (Cannot be used together with /do).
> 
> Use /t to filter tasks by tags.
> 
> `<KEYWORD>` are **case-insensitive**. 
> 
> Parameters can be in any order.

Examples: 
* `find meet John` uses Quick Search and returns all tasks containing BOTH the keywords “meet” and “John” (e.g. meet John Doe)
* `find /n meet /dt 17/10/2016 1300 to 18/10/2016 1400` uses Filter Search and returns all tasks whose name contains "meet" and whose task date falls within the range "17/10/2016 1300 to 18/10/2016 1400" (e.g. meet Tim for dinner, 17/10/2016 1800 to 17/10/2016 1900)

```
###### /UserGuide.md
``` md
#### Reserving timeslots for a task : `rsv`
