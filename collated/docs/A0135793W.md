#### Jia Wern: `iCal`

**Pros**

* Can add events very easily by clicking in the corresponding timeslot.
* Can change duration of events easily by dragging the borders of the event.
* Has flexibility in terms of being able to set a task to be a recurring task, setting an event to be an entire day and even setting alarms/reminders for the event.
* Can categorize events and each category is distinctly colour coded.
* Works across all platforms (desktop, tablet, phone).
* Can search for events.
* Can undo their previous action.

**Cons**

* Requires users to fill details individually into the respective categories. There is no option to type everything in one line and the relevant sections will be filled up automatically.
* Has no way to mark an item as done.
* Has no automatic way to block of timings. An actual event has to be created and deleted should the event is not happening anymore.

#### Save/Load data: `path`
Saves data to a specified folder.<br>
Format: `path <filepath>.xml`

* Windows OS FILEPATH format example: `C:\\Users\\<username>\\Desktop\\CS2103 Tutorial\\TasKitty.xml`
* Mac OS FILEPATH format example: `/Users/<username>/Desktop/CS2103 Tutorial/TasKitty.xml`

> TasKitty must end with a .xml extension.<br>
> TasKitty will save any other FILEPATH format in the same directory as TasKitty.<br>
> TasKitty will automatically create the folder if the folder is not present.<br>
> TasKitty can load data from an existing .xml file if TasKitty is empty.<br>

Example:

* `path /Users/<username>/Desktop/CS2103 Tutorial/TasKitty.xml`<br>
  Saves TasKitty data into the folder CS2103 Tutorial with TasKitty.xml as the filename.<br>
  If folder CS2103 Tutorial is not present, TasKitty will create the folder.
