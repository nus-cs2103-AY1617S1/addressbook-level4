## Introduction

Amethyst is a command-line task manager targeted at power users who would like to store, access and edit information about their tasks efficiently.

This guide describes the design and implementation of Amethyst, to help you understand how Amethyst works. Relevant information regarding implementation, testing and available developer tools/resources have also been included in this guide to help you along as you work on Amethyst's future development. We have organised this guide in a top-down manner so that you can understand the big picture before moving on to the more detailed sections.

## Setting Up

### Prerequisites

1. Install Java 8 Update 60 (JDK `1.8.0_60`) or higher.  <br>
	Download the latest version via this [link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

    > Note that the application will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
2. Install Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  <br>
    Download the latest version via this [link](http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/).
    
3. Install e(fx)clipse plugin for Eclipse.  <br>
    Begin at Step 2, with reference to this [instructional guide](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious).
   
4. Install Buildship Gradle Integration plugin for Eclipse from the Eclipse Marketplace.  <br>
	Install the latest version via this [link](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/buildship-gradle-integration).


### Import existing project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repository, and clone the fork to your computer.
2. Open Eclipse 
	
	> Ensure that you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugins as stated
   in the prerequisites above.
   
3. Click `File` > `Import`.
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`.
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory.
6. Click `Finish`.

  > Select `keep` if you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' configuration files.
  >
  > Note that project set up may take up to 30 minutes to finish. Project set up duration varies according to connection speed and server load. (Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process.)
  > 
  > Discard changes if Eclipse auto-changed any settings file during the import process.

<br>
## Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureClassDiagram.PNG" width="800"><br>

> Diagram 1: Architecture Class Diagram

The _Architecture Class Diagram_ given above explains to you the high-level design of the App.
You can refer to the sections below to get a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#commons-component) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of tha App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>
<img src="images/LogicComponentClassDiagram.PNG" width="800"><br>

> Diagram 2: Logic Component Class Diagram

The _Delete Task Sequence Diagram_ below shows you how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 3`.

<img src="images\DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.PNG" width="800">

> Diagram 3: Delete Task Sequence Diagram

> This diagram shows you how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskManagerChangedEvent` when the Task Manager data are changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below illustrates to you how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>
<img src="images\DeleteTaskEventHandlingSequenceDiagram.PNG" width="800">

> Diagram 4: Delete Task Event Handing Sequence Diagram

> This diagram shows you how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps to reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

You can refer to the sections below for more details of each component.

<br>
## UI Component

<img src="images/UiComponentClassDiagram.PNG" width="800"><br>

> Diagram 5: UI Component Class Diagram

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

As you can see in the diagram, the UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these different parts, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of each UI part is defined in the corresponding `.fxml` file in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly

<br>
## Logic Component

<img src="images/LogicComponentClassDiagram.PNG" width="800"><br>

> Diagram 6: Logic Component Class Diagram

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. The `Parser` class returns a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>  
 
<img src="images/DeleteTaskSequenceDiagramForLogic.PNG" width="800"><br>

> Diagram 7: Delete Task Sequence Diagram within Logic Component

<br>
## Model Component

<img src="images/ModelComponentClassDiagram.PNG" width="800"><br>

> Diagram 8: Model Component Class Diagram

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`:
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Task Manager data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<br>
## Storage Component

<img src="images/StorageComponentClassDiagram.PNG" width="800"><br>

> Diagram 9: Storage Component Class Diagram

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component:
* reads user preferences in JSON format, and task manager data in XML format, from file paths specified in configuration file.
* saves changes to user preferences in JSON format, and task manager data in XML format.

<br>
## Commons Component

You can find all classes used by multiple components in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

<br>
## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`):

<br>
## Testing

You can find the tests in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests
  as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. 
   These are in the `guitests` package.
  
2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units 
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as 
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`
  
**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 you can run our GUI tests in the _headless_ mode. 
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running. 
 You can look at [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
  
<br>
## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

Refer to [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

Refer to [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) to learn how to use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on your project.

### Making a Release

To create a new release:
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repository with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Crete a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file your created.
   
### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Task Manager depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than the following alternatives.<br>  
  - Include those libraries in the repository (this bloats the repository size)<br>  
  - Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

<br>
## Future Development

There are several additions that can be made to Amethyst to further increase its usefulness and usability.

#### GUI customisation
The GUI of the current implementation is fixed and cannot be changed. Allowing the user to customise the GUI
according to his/ her preferences, would enhance user experience and ease of use.

#### Saving and loading of statistics
By enabling user to save and load usage and productivity statistics (number of event/ deadline/ someday tasks 
completed or missed), user will be able to track work progress and improve upon his/ her work productivity.

#### Better command feedback
Having more specific feedback to users' commands will allow users to find that what exactly happened after 
the command was entered. Invalid commands will show more intelligent feedback based on what the user entered.

#### Auto-completion of commands
Allowing users to press a key to auto-complete a command makes it much easier to enter commands and 
reduces the margin of error.

#### History of commands
Users can traverse this history to re-execute previously typed commands. This becomes especially useful if a 
user wants to collate the source files in the same folder periodically.

<br>
## 2. Guidelines
```
###### \UserGuide.md
``` md
<br>
### 3.4. Find tasks containing particular keyword(s) in task name: `find`
Search for a task by name by specifying the keywords/ keyphrases used in the task name. This command finds all tasks containing any of the specified keywords/keyphrases and displays the identified tasks in a numbered list.

Format: `find KEYPHRASE_WORD_ONE KEYPHRASE_WORD_TWO [KEYPHRASE_MORE_WORDS] ..., [MORE_KEYPHRASES] ...`

> Do note the following:
> - Keyphrases are separated by commas.
> - The search is case-insensitive. For example, `hANs bo` will match `Hans Bo`.
> - The order of the keywords within each phrase matters. For example, `Hans Bo` will not match `Bo Hans`.
> - The order of the keyphrases does not matter. For example, `Bo, Hans` will match `Hans Swagtacular Bo`.
> - Only the name of the task is searched.
> - Partial phrases will be matched For example, `ns B` will match `Hans Bo`.

Examples:
- `find meeting` <br>
  Returns `Meeting with John` and `Skytok project meeting` tasks.
- `find Physics test, chemistry, biology` <br>
  Returns all tasks containing any of the keywords/keyphrases `Physics test`, `chemistry`, or `biology`.


<br>
### 3.5. Delete task(s): `del`
Do you have a previously stored task that is no longer relevant? Delete the task from the task manager by specifying its index. <br>

Format: `del INDEX [MORE_INDICES] ...`

> Do note the following:
> - You may delete multiple tasks at one go, by specifying the indices of all the tasks that you wish to delete.  
> - The indices refer to the index numbers shown in the most recent listing.  
> - Indices entered must be positive integers (1, 2, 3, ..).

Examples:
- `list`<br>
  `del 2 4`<br>
  Deletes the second and fourth tasks in the task manager.
- `find birthday`<br>
  `del 1`<br>
  Deletes the first task found by `find birthday`.


<br>
### 3.6. Mark task(s) as done: `done`
Completed a task? Hurray! Give yourself a pat on the back for a job well done! Mark the task as done by specifying its index. <br>

Format: `done INDEX [MORE_INDICES] ...`

> Do note the following:
> - You may mark multiple tasks as done at one go, by specifying the indices of all the tasks you have completed.  
> - The indices refer to the index numbers shown in the most recent listing.  
> - Indices entered must be positive integers (1, 2, 3, ..).

Examples:
- `list not-done`<br>
  `done 5 8 9`<br>
  Marks the fifth, eighth and ninth tasks listed by `list not-done` as done.
- `find report`<br>
  `done 2`<br>
  Deletes the second task found by `find report`.


```
###### \UserGuide.md
``` md
<br>
### 3.10. Clear all entries: `clear`
Looking for a fresh start? Clear all entries from the task manager by entering `clear`. <br>

Format: `clear`


<br>
### 3.11. Set data storage location: `set-storage`
Set task manager data storage location according to your specifications. Task manager data will be saved to the folder, and with the file name you specify.

Format: `set-storage FOLDER_FILE_PATH save-as FILE_NAME`

> Do note the following:
> - All task manager data will be transferred to the new storage location. Data in the original location will be deleted.
> - You will need to exit and restart Amethyst for the new storage settings to be registered.

Example:
`set-storage C:\\Users\\Liang\\Desktop save-as TaskInformation`


<br>
### 3.12. Set an alias for an existing command: `add-alias`
Add a new shortcut for an existing command. <br>

Format: `add-alias 'COMMAND_ALIAS'='COMMAND_PHRASE'`

> Do note that on pressing `enter`, the entire string specified on the right-hand side of the equals sign will replace the alias.
> If an alias is typed within quotes, however, it will _not_ be replaced.

Examples:
- `add-alias 'add-dl'='add deadline'`  <br>
The command input `add-dl 'Clean the garage' by 17:00 on 04-05-14` can now be used in place of `add deadline 'Clean the garage' by 17:00 on 04-05-1`. However, note that `add deadline 'buy add-dl a cake' by 4:00pm 12-Oct-16` does not register as `add deadline 'buy add deadline a cake' by 4:00pm 12-Oct-16`, since `add-dl` was enclosed by quotation marks.


<br>
### 3.13. List aliases: `list-alias`
List all configured aliases. <br>

Format: `list-alias`


<br>
### 3.14. Delete alias(es): `delete-alias | remove-alias`
Remove previously set aliases by specifying their indices. <br>

Format: `(delete-alias | remove-alias) INDEX [MORE_INDICES] ...`

Example:
- `list-alias`  
 `remove-alias 2 3` <br>
  Deletes the second and third aliases given by the `list-alias` command.


<br>
### 3.15. Auto-save
Amethyst auto-saves all changes after each command execution. No more 'changes were not saved' nightmares! 

<br>
### 3.16. Exit Amethyst: `exit`
Exit the program by keying in `exit`. <br>

Format: `exit`

```
