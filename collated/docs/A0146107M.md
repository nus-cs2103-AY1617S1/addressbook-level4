#### Todo.txt (studied by Lester Tan)

Strengths:

1. Simple command line interface (CLI) as opposed to traditional graphical user interface (GUI).
2. UNIX-style input, for those used to UNIX.
3. Minimal keystrokes and taps required to speed up the process of command input
4. Syncing between computer program and mobile application, for easy access to the task list for users on-the-go.
5. Open-source: allows user-written extensions to be integrated. Allows powerful features to be integrated by the user.
6. Ability to mark a task as a priority.
7. Allows a series of tasks in a project to be listed out, for a smooth flow of work within a certain project.
8. Able to set tags ("contexts") for easy reference and grouping of similar tasks together.

Weaknesses:

1. CLI, which, compared to a GUI, might be more daunting to less tech-savvy users.
2. Fixed format for entering dates, thus users have to remember a specific format each time they enter a date.
3. No feature to search for free slots, thus users have to manually look for an empty slot before adding a task in.

#### Adding a task : `add`
Adds a task, deadline, event or a floating task to the list. <br>
Format: `add TASKNAME [at/from START_TIMEDATE] [by/to END_TIMEDATE] [r/RECURRING] [p/PRIORITY]`

> * For tasks and events, at least one of the two TIMEDATE values must be included.<br>
> * For floating tasks, none of the TIMEDATE values are specified.<br>
> * If the taskname contains keywords like "add", the user can enter it using the escape character '\'.
* `add Shop \at Topshop at 5pm`
> * Priority must be low/med/high. If priority is not specified, default priority of low is set.
> * Recurring frequency can be either of daily, weekly, monthly or yearly.
> * If START_TIMEDATE exceeds END_TIMEDATE, the addition of task will not be successful.

Examples: 
* `add Buy eggs at 5pm 13/09/2016 r/weekly p/high`
* `add Meeting from 13/09/2016 5pm to 13/09/2016 7pm p/med`
* `add Pay bills by 13/09/2016 5pm`
* `add Do laundry p/low`

#### Searching for tasks : `find`
Lists tasks whose names match the given input.<br>
Format: `find SEARCHSTRING`

> * The search is case insensitive. e.g `buy` will match `Buy`
> * Wild cards can be indicated with an asterisk `*` e.g. `B* eggs` will match `Buy eggs`
> * Only the name is searched.
> * Tasks containing the entered text will be matched e.g. `Buy` will match `Must buy eggs`

Examples: 
* `find b*y`<br>

> * Returns both `buy` and `buy eggs`

#### Deleting a task : `delete`
Deletes the specified task.<br>
Format: `delete INDEX/TASKNAME`

> * Deletes the task at the specified index
> * If TASKNAME is entered instead, and only one task matches the name, it will be deleted. 
> * If TASKNAME is entered, and there are multiple tasks with matching names, then they are all displayed along with their indices. In this scenario, the user can only proceed with deletion using the index of the appropriate task.

Examples:
* `delete 1`

> * Deletes task at index 1

* `delete b*y`

> * If only 1 task matches the entered text, it is deleted. Otherwise, the tasks matching `b*y*` will be listed for the user to choose from.

#### Autocomplete feature: `TAB` button

* Pressing TAB after entering `un` will complete `undo`

#### Command History: `UP` and `DOWN` arrows
Traverse through previously entered commands.
Format: NIL

> UP displays the next older command.

Format: `help`

> The help page will open in a new window.
