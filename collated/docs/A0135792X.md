## Setting up

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


#### Importing the project into Eclipse

0. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
1. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given
   in the prerequisites above)
2. Click `File` > `Import`
3. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
4. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
5. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

## Design

### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskmanager/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>

### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskmanager/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ItemDetailsPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`,  etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskmanager/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

## Appendix B : Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `taskmanager` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

#### Use case: Add a task/deadline/event
**Main Success Scenario (MSS)**

1. User requests to add task/deadline/event (TDE).
2. TaskManager adds TDE and displays result. <br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**
>1a. Some or all required parameters are missing.
>1a1. TaskManager shows an error message. <br>
>Use case resumes at step 1.

```
###### /DeveloperGuide.md
``` md

#### Use case: List all tasks
1.User requests to list all tasks
2.TaskManager shows a list of tasks

#### Use case: List all deadlines
1.User requests to list all deadlines
2.TaskManager shows a list of deadlines

#### Use case: List all events
1.User requests to list all events
2.TaskManager shows a list of events

#### Use case: Delete an task/deadline/event

**MSS**

1. User requests to list task/deadline/event (TDE).
2. TaskManager shows a list of TDEs.
3. User requests to delete a specific TDE in the list.
4. TaskManager deletes the TDE. <br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

>2a. The TDE list is empty. <br>
>Use case ends.


> 3a. The given index is invalid.
> 3a1. TaskManager shows an error message. <br>
> Use case resumes at step 2.


>3b. User requests to delete two TDEs.
>3b1. TaskManager deletes the TDEs. <br>
>Use case ends.

## Appendix E : Product Survey

Product Name | Strengths | Weaknesses           | Remarks
-------- | :------- | :---------------------- | :---------------
Google Calendar  | Used worldwide, easy to use, understands NLP | Slow, requires internet access, has crashed in recent history  | Our application works offline and is both faster and has NLP as well
Todo.txt        | Works across devices and operating systems    | Quite complicated for new users to pick up as it has a whole range of shortcut-commands | Our application accepts both short cut commands and normal commands, and syncs with Google Calendar to work across devices and platforms
Swipes          | Simple, cross-platform                        | Unable to specify data storage location  | Our application allows users to specify a location to save data
Fantastical     | Uses NLP, quick access in mini window         | Works only on Mac/iOS platform | Our application works on major computer operating systems, and since it allows syncing onto Google Calendar, one can even use mobile devices to view and update their task manager
Apple Reminders | Easy-to-use, fast, backed up on the cloud     | Only works in Apple's ecosystem  | Our application allows users to back up to Google Calendar, which works on most devices and thus most people can use it, along with backing up their data to the cloud through Google Calendar
Sunrise  | Works across platforms and devices     | Requires internet access to work | Our application works both online and offline
