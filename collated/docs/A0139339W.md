### 3.1. View help : `help`
New to Amethyst? Simply type `help` and press `Enter` to view a list of all commands and their corresponding command formats. 

Format: `help`

> Do note that the help window is also shown if you enter an incorrect command e.g. `abcd`.

<br>
### 3.2. Add a task: `add`

Embark on your first step to using Amethyst, by adding tasks to the task manager! Amethyst supports three different types of tasks, namely tasks to be done someday, deadlines and events.

<br>
#### Tasks to be done someday: `add (someday | sd)`
If you have tasks to be done someday, you can add it as a `someday` task using either the `someday` or `sd` keyword.  

Format: `add (someday | sd) 'NAME'`

Examples:
- `add someday 'Read Introduction to Algorithms book'`
- `add sd 'Organise study table'`

<br>
#### Deadlines: `add (deadline | dl)`
If you have tasks to be done by a certain date and time, you can add it as a `deadline` task using either the `deadline` or `dl` keyword.

Format: `add (deadline | dl) 'NAME' by HH:MM DD-MM-YY`

Examples:
- `add deadline 'Read lecture notes' by 16:00 12-10-16`
- `add dl 'RSVP to networking event' by 23:59 07-03-10`  

<br>
#### Events: `add (event | ev)`
If you have tasks to be done within a certain period, you can add it as an `event` task using either the `event` or `ev` keyword.  

Format: `add (event | ev) 'NAME' from HH:MM DD-MM-YY to HH:MM DD-MM-YY`

Examples:
- `add event 'Medical appointment' from 11:00 to 13:00 on 23-09-15`
- `add ev 'Jake and Lucy wedding dinner' from 18:00 to 21:00 on 11-11-11`

<br>
### 3.3. List tasks: `list`
After adding your tasks, you can take a look at what you have added so far using the list command. This command shows a numbered list of tasks filtered by the arguments you specify. If you list without specifying any argument, a list of all tasks added will be shown. 

Format: `list [TASK_TYPE] [done|not-done] [DD-MM-YY] [HH:MM]`

> Do note the following:
> - The three valid task types are `someday`, `deadline` and `event`.  
> - Tasks will be listed in chronological order.  
> - If you specify the time argument, tasks will be filtered as follows:  
>   * `event` tasks that are occuring at the specified time, start and end time inclusive.
>   * `deadline` tasks that are due before the specified time.

Examples:
- `list someday not-done`  <br>
Lists all `someday` tasks that have not been completed.
- `list deadline 16-11-16` <br>
Lists all `deadline` tasks that are due on 16 November 2016.
