### Review of [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/)
#### Strengths:
- Adds different kind of colouring to the schedule.
- Undo addition or deletion of events.
- Create multiple calendar for different purposes.
- GUI is quite intuitive. The formatting is clear and it does not require guidelines.
- Able to use calendar in offline mode.


#### Weaknesses:
- Unable to view all deleted events or reminders.
- It does not have command-line inputs to modify the calendar; most operations require a user to click, which can be time-consuming.
- Only accessible via browsers; no desktop application available.
