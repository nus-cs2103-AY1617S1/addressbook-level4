### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
*Figure 10: Class Diagram of Storage component*

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/teamfour/tasc/storage/Storage.java)

The **`Storage`** component
* saves `UserPref` objects in json format and reads it back.
* saves `TaskList` in xml format and reads it back.
* depends on the **`Model`** component, but the **`Logic`** and **`UI`** components depend on it.
<br><br>

**`Storage` Interface:**

The **`Storage`** interface allows you to request for any storage-related operations, such as reading and saving the user's preferences and tasklist.

**Notable APIs**

Return type | Method and Description
----------- | ----------------------
Optional<`UserPrefs`> | `readUserPrefs()`: Reads User's Preferences.
void | `saveUserPrefs(UserPrefs userPrefs)`: Saves User's Preferences.
Optional<`ReadOnlyTaskList`> | `readTaskList()`: Reads the tasklist.
void | `saveTaskList(ReadOnlyTaskList taskList)`: Saves the tasklist.
<br>

**`StorageManager` Class:**

The `StorageManager` class implements the **`Storage`** interface, and provides all the services and functionality
specified in the **`Storage`** interface.

Other components should reference this class indirectly by using the **`Storage`** interface. You should not
directly use this class outside the **`Storage`** component.
<br><br>

**`TaskListStorage` , `UserPrefsStorage` Interfaces:**

Represent the storage for `TaskList` and `UserPrefs`.
<br><br>

**`JsonUserPrefsStorage` Class:**

The `JsonUserPrefsStorage` class is provided for accessing `UserPrefs` stored in the hard disk as a json file.
<br><br>

**`XmlAdaptedTag` , `XmlAdaptedTask`, `XmlFileStorage`, `XmlSerializableTaskList`, `XmlTaskListStorage` Class:**

JAXB-friendly adapted version of the `Tag` and `Task` and Task Lists.

#### iCalendar

Strengths:

* User can view upcoming tasks easily, on both macOS and iOS (also via Siri)
* Add tasks with natural language input
* A complete command list provided for users (keyboard shortcuts), which is easy to remember
* Event has many properties, (e.g. tag, location, date, time, description, alert before event, description, repeat, attachments)
* Can choose specific functions for tags (e.g. whether to sync, universal alert time)
* Specify location on map
* Invite function
* Sharing with friends via email or iMessage
* Importing events from other calendar apps
* Add event from email, and even from date/time expressions in some other chatting apps
* Festivals and holidays are already stored, according to user’s geolocation
* Can set to private or public
* Highlights the dates of friends’ birthdays and any important dates (Found in Facebook, Apple ID, etc)

Weaknesses:

* User has to specify the time period
* Events/tasks cannot be marked as done
* Problem in importing from other app: duplicates may appear sometimes
* No feature for reserving time blocks
* No priority/importance feature

Summary:

Its design is very user-friendly. Since it is supported by other powerful modules by Apple, it has relatively complete features and functionalities. However, it would be better if further details of tasks and events are supported.

Our Program:

We will implement completion status. We will implement prioritizing of tasks through using tags.

###  Redoing the last action: `redo`

Whenver you want to redo the tasks you undid, you can simply reverse them by redoing.
Only tasks that are undone right before you type redo (Without any other commands 
entered) can be actually redone.

`redo`

<br>
You can redo the last *X* number of actions. For example, to redo the
last 4 actions taken:

`redo 4`

<br>
In general, you may use this format to redo various number of changes.
`redo [LAST STEPS]`
 * LAST STEPS refer to the number of steps to redo, starting from the lastest step. 

If you simply type:
`redo`
, the last step undone will be redone.

### Switching to a different task list: `switchlist`

You should keep different schedules on separate lists (for example,
one list `work.xml` for your tasks in your daily job, and another list `life.xml`
for your activities outside your work).

To do so, simply type the switch list command:

`switchlist life`

> **Tip:**<br>
> If the file does not exist, TaSc will assume that you want to create a new
> task list, and will create an empty file for you automatically.

<br>
In general, you may use this format to switch to different lists.
`switchlist FILENAME`
<br>


### Renaming the task list file: `renamelist`

You may wish to rename your task list. For example, if your list is
currently named `life.xml` and you would like to rename it to `family.xml`, enter:

`renamelist family`

<br>
In general, you may use this format to rename lists.
`renamelist FILENAME`
<br>

### Relocating the data storage location: `relocate`

For convenience, you may want to move the entire folder, where all your task lists
are stored, to another location. For example, you want to move your task list into
your Dropbox folder so that you can access it on another computer. Presuming your Dropbox
folder is at `/dropbox/`, you may do so by typing:

`relocate dropbox/tasklist`

> **Tip:**<br>
> enter `relocate` without designated path and the app will relocate the
> file to the original path.

<br>
In general, you may use this format to relocate your data to different location.
`relocate PATH`
<br>
