## Appendix B : Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `JYM` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

#### Use case: Mark Task completed.

**MSS**

1. User requests to view list of active tasks
2. System shows list of tasks
3. User requests to mark a task as completed from the list.
4. System marks task as completed <br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. The list is empty

> Use case ends

3a. The given index is invalid

> 3a1. JYM shows an error message <br>
  Use case resumes at step 2

#### Use case: Update Task

**MSS**

1. User requests to view list of active tasks
2. System shows list of tasks
3. User requests to update a task with given description and/or deadline
4. System updates task.
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. List is empty

> Use case ends

3a. Given index invalid

> 3a1. JYM shows error message <br>
  Use case resumes at step 2
  
3b. Invalid deadline supplied by user

> 3b1. JYM returns error message <br>
  Use case resumes at step 2

## Appendix C : Non Functional Requirements

1. Program should load within 5 seconds
2. Storage file should be limited to 100MB default (can be changed by user)
3. Should work on any mainstream OS
4. Should hold up to 1000 tasks/events on the active task list at any time
5. Comes with automated unit tests.
6. Commands should be intuitive and easy to use.
7. Interface is simple and easy to understand for beginners (i.e. people seeing it for the first time are not confused by what box does what).

## Appendix D : Glossary

##### Mainstream OS

> Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X

##### Task

> An activity that needs to be completed by a certain date or time. Contains
a description, deadline, and priority.

##### Event

> An activity that happens within a set boundary of time, with a start and end time on a given date.
Contains a description, event date and time, priority, and location.

##### Floating Task

> A task with no set deadline. 

##### Active Task List

> List of tasks that have yet to be marked complete and whose deadlines have not passed yet.



## Appendix E : Product Survey

##### Google Calendar Quickadd

> Satisfies many stories, but cannot add multiple events simultaneously, and does not hold support for both tasks and events. <br>
> Everything is an event, and although one can create them in a certain way to make them act like tasks, it can be tedious and not optimal to do so.

> **Command Format**
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters.
> * Items in `SQUARE_BRACKETS` are optional.
> * Items with `...` after them can have multiple instances.
> * The order of parameters is fixed.

#### Viewing help : `help`
Format: `help`

#### Adding a task or event: `add`
Adds a task or event to the task list. <br>
Format: `add [TASK/EVENT] DESCRIPTION [due/at/by DATE START_TIME END_TIME] [PRIORITY]`

> Adding tasks or events can also be done through simple English.<br>
> If only one time is specified, it will be interpreted as a deadline. Otherwise, the event will use the input as start and end time.
> If no command keyword is specified, the app assumes the given command is to add, and will interpret the input as a task or event depending on whether a start and end time is given or not. <br>

Examples:
* `do laundry at home JULY 24 5 PM`
    Adds a task with the description `do laundry` and the deadline `5PM 07/24`
* `write sql queries by tomorrow 9pm`
    Adds a task with the description `write sql queries` and the deadline `9PM [tomorrow]`, with tomorrow being whatever date the next day is.
* `dinner with jack tomorrow at 5 pm to 6pm`
    Adds an event with the description `dinner with jack` with the time 5 to 6 pm tomorrow.

#### Listing all tasks and events: `list`
Shows a list of all the tasks and/or events in the program. <br>
Format: `list`

> The list command alone lists all upcoming tasks and events.<br>
> When appended with task or event, the program will show only the requested input (tasks or events). <br>
> By default list shows upcoming active tasks and events.

<!-- #### List all tasks and events in calendar format: `calendar`
Shows all the tasks and events in calendar format. <br>
Format: `calendar [TASK/EVENT]` -->

<!-- > The calendar command alone shows all tasks and events. <br>
> When appended with task or event, the program will show only the requested input (tasks or events). <br>
> Can be combined with `view` to achieve a popup window of the calendar -->

<!-- #### Viewing information in a pop-out window: `view`
Puts the information into a separate window for easier viewing. Should mainly be used in conjunction with `list` and `calendar` commands. <br>
Format: `view [LIST/CALENDAR]`

> Must be followed by either list or calendar-`view` cannot be called on its own. -->

#### Finding all tasks and events with a given keyword in the description or title: `find`
Searches for tasks and events whose descriptions or titles contain any of the given keywords or dates.<br>
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` <br>

> * By appending certain keywords onto the search, one can filter results. e.g. `completed` will search for completed tasks only, `ordered` will search for tasks with all the keywords in the given order and grouped together.
> * Search is not case sensitive. e.g. `ChiCKEN` will match `cHIcken` 
> * Order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `do this` will match `this do`. This can be changed by adding specific keywords.
> * The description and date are both searched. e.g. `eat dinner july 30` will result in tasks and events from july 30 matching `eat dinner`
> * Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (not including dates). These settings can be changed by setting flags in the command.

<!-- > * By default search will search for all tasks and events. By appending `all` to the end of the search, one can search among all events and tasks. `completed` is mentioned earlier as well. -->

Examples:
* `find write SQL queries july 21` <br>
    Returns upcoming tasks with `write SQL queries` in the description on july 21.
* `find birthday all` <br>
    Returns all events with `birthday` in the description or title.
* `find CS2103 final` <br>
    Returns upcoming tasks and events with `CS2103 final` in the description
    
#### Undo mistaken commands: `undo`
Reverses the last command done. Repeated calls to this command will undo each command in the reverse order of that which they were called. Can only go back up to 20 commands in history via undos. <br>
Format: `undo`

```
