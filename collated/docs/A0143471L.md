| Todoist |  Has a very simple design. <br>Offers a mobile app. <br>Has a feature where users are encouraged to earn "Todoist Karma", to track their productivity trends as they finish their tasks.| Free version is limited in its capabilities and  is not well-encrypted. <br>Some of the mobile apps have design issues (like being unable to sort tasks). <br>Free version does not come up with some features like reminders, filters, labels, and templates. |
| Trello | Can divide projects up by tasks, and then edit those tasks with descriptions, labels, checklists, and even attachments. <br>Is particularly helpful for teams working on separate tasks toward a greater project goal, where the tasks are in need of a pipeline. | Has no good way to use this system to prioritize tasks between projects. |
