#### Notes on FlexiTrack timing  
1. FlexiTrack does support year. However, make sure that you also specify the hour of the timing 
	as FlexiTrack will choose timing over year when it is uncertain. 
2. When you do not specify the exact timing, FlexiTrack will assign your task to be 7.59 for due
	date and starting time, and 16.59 for ending time. 

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with 
       the file that contains the data of your previous FlexiTrack folder.
