### 1. Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above summarizes the high-level design of Agendum.
Here is a quick overview of the main components of Agendum and their main responsibilities.

#### `Main`
The **`Main`** component has a single class: [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/MainApp.java). It is responsible for initializing all components in the correct sequence and connecting them up with each other at app launch. It is also responsible for shutting down the other components and invoking the necessary clean up methods when Agendum is shut down.


#### `Commons`
[**`Commons`**](#6-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two Commons classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCentre` (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events.
* `LogsCenter` is used by many classes to write log messages to Agendum's log file to record noteworthy system information and events.


#### `UI`
The [**`UI`**](#2-ui-component) component is responsible for interacting with the user by accepting commands, displaying data and results such as updates to the task list.


#### `Logic`
The [**`Logic`**](#3-logic-component) component is responsible for processing and executing the user's commands.


#### `Model`
The [**`Model`**](#4-model-component) component is responsible for representing and holding Agendum's data.


#### `Storage`
The [**`Storage`**](#5-storage-component) component is responsible for reading data from and writing data to the hard disk.


Each of the `UI`, `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage` components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>


#### Event Driven Approach
Agendum applies an Event-Driven approach and the **Observer Pattern** to reduce direct coupling between the various components. For example, the `UI` and `Storage` components are interested in receiving notifications when there is a change in the to-do list in `Model`. To avoid bidrectional coupling, `Model` does not inform these components of changes directly. Instead, it posts an event and rely on the `EventsCenter` to notifying the register Observers in `Storage` and `UI`.

Consider the scenario where the user inputs `delete 1` described in the _Sequence Diagram_ below. The `UI` component will invoke the `Logic` component’s  _execute_ method to carry out the given command, `delete 1`. The `Logic` component will identify the corresponding task and will call the `Model` component _deleteTasks_ method to update Agendum’s data and raise a `ToDoListChangedEvent`.

<img src="images\SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800">

The diagram below shows what happens after a `ToDoListChangedEvent` is raised. `EventsCenter` will inform its subscribers. `Storage` will respond and save the changes to hard disk while `UI` will respond and update the status bar to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>

<img src="images\SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800">

#### Model-View-Controller approach
To further reduce coupling between components, the Model-View-Controller pattern is also applied. The 3 components are as follows:
* Model: The `Model` component as previously described, maintains and holds Agendum's data.
* View: Part of the `UI` components and resources such as the .fxml file is responsible for displaying Agendum's data and interacting with the user. Through events, the `UI` component is able to get data updates from the model.
* Controller: Parts of the `UI` component such as (`CommandBox`) act as 'Controllers' for part of the UI. The `CommandBox` accepts user command input and request `Logic` to execute the command entered. This execution may result in changes in the model.


#### Activity Diagram

<img src="images\activityDiagram.jpg" width="800"> <br>

The Activity Diagram above illustrates Agendum's workflow. Brown boxes represent actions taken by Agendum while orange boxes represent actions that involve interaction with the user.  

After Agendum is launched, Agendum will wait for the user to enter a command. Every command is parsed. If the command is valid and adheres to the given format, Agendum will executes the command. Agendum `Logic` component checks the input such as indices before updating the model and storage if needed.  

Agendum will then display changes in the to-do list and feedback of each command in the UI. The user can then enter a command again. Agendum will also give pop-up feedbacks when the command format or inputs are invalid.

The following sections will then give more details of each individual component.


```

### 4. Model component

As mentioned above, the `Model` component stores and manages Agendum's task list data and user's preferences. It also exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' by other components e.g. the `UI` can be bound to this list and will automatically update when the data in the list change.

Due to the application of the **Observer Pattern**, it does not depend on other components such as `Storage` but interact by raising events instead.

The `Model` class is the interface of the `Model` component. It provides several APIs for the `Logic` and `UI` components to update and retrieve Agendum’s task list data. The **API** of the model component can be found at [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/model/Model.java).  

The structure and relationship of the various classes in the `Model` component is described in the diagram below.    

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

`ModelManager` implements the `Model` Interface. It contains a `UserPref` Object which represents the user’s preference and a `SyncManager` object which is necessary for the integration with Google calendar.

`SyncManager` implements the `Sync` Interface. The `SyncManager` redirects the job of syncing a task to a `SyncProvider`. In Agendum, we have one provider, `SyncProviderGoogle` that implements the `SyncProvider` Interface. This is done so that it would be easy to extend Agendum to sync with other providers. One would just have to create a new class that extends the `SyncProvider` Interface and register that class with `SyncManager`.

`ModelManager` contains a **main** `ToDoList` object and a stack of `ToDoList` objects referred to as `previousLists`. The **main** `ToDoList` object is the copy that is indirectly referred to by the `UI` and `Storage`. The stack, `previousLists` is used to support the [`undo` operation](#### undo).

Each `ToDoList` object has one `UniqueTaskList` object. A `UniqueTaskList` can contain multiple `Task` objects but does not allow duplicates.  

The `ReadOnlyToDoList` and `ReadOnlyTask` interfaces allow other classes and components, such as the `UI`, to access but not modify the list of tasks and their details.  

Currently, each `Task` has a compulsory `Name` and last updated time. It is optional for a `Task` to have a start and end time. Each `Task` also has a completion status which is represented by a boolean.

Design considerations:
> * `ToDoList` is a distinct class from `UniqueTaskList` as it can potentially be extended to have another `UniqueTagList` object to keep track of tags associated with each task and `ToDoList` will be responsible for syncing the tasks and tags.
> * `Name` is a separate class as it might be modified to have its own validation regex e.g. no / or "

Using the same example, if the `Logic` component requests `Model` to _deleteTasks(task)_, the subsequent interactions between objects can be described by the following sequence diagram.  

<img src="images\SDforDeleteTaskModelComponent.png" width="800">

The identified task is removed from the `UniqueTaskList`. The `ModelManager` raises a `ToDoListChangedEvent` and back up the current to do list to `previousLists`

> `Model`’s _deleteTasks_ methods actually take in `ArrayList<ReadOnlyTask>` instead of a single task. We use _deleteTasks(task)_ for simplicity in the sequence diagram.


#### undo

`previousLists` is a Stack of `ToDoList` objects with a minimum size of 1. The `ToDoList` object at the top of the stack is identical to the **main** `ToDoList` object before any operation that mutate the to-do list is performed and after any operation that mutates the task list successfully (i.e. without exceptions).

This is achieved with the _backupCurrentToDoList_ function which pushes a copy of the **main** `ToDoList` to the stack after any successful changes, such as the marking of multiple tasks.

To undo the most recent changes, we simply pop the irrelevant `ToDoList` at the top of the `previousLists` stack and copy the `ToDoList` at the top of the stack back to the **main** list 

This approach is reliable as it eliminates the need to implement an "undo" method and store the changes separately for each command that will mutate the task list.

Also, it helps to resolve the complications involved with manipulating multiple task objects at a go. For example, the user might try to mark multiple tasks and one of which will result in a `DuplicateTaskException`. To revert the undesired changes to the **main** `ToDoList`, we can copy the the `ToDoList` at the top of the stack back to the **main** list. In such unsuccessful operations, the changes would not have persisted to Storage.

## Implementation

### 1. Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#2-configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

Currently, Agendum has 4 logging levels: `SEVERE`, `WARNING`, `INFO` and `FINE`. They record information pertaining to:

* `SEVERE` : A critical problem which may cause the termination of Agendum<br>
   e.g. fatal error during the initialization of Agendum's main window
* `WARNING` : A problem which requires attention and caution but allows Agendum to continue working<br>
   e.g. error reading from/saving to config file
* `INFO` : Noteworthy actions by Agendum<br>
  e.g. valid and invalid commands executed and their results
* `FINE` : Less significant details that may be useful in debugging<br>
  e.g. all fine details of the tasks including their last updated time

### 2. Configuration

You can alter certain properties of our Agendum application (e.g. logging level) through the configuration file.
(default:`config.json`).

## Appendix E : Product Survey

We conducted a product survey on other task managers. Here is a summary of the strengths and weaknesses of each application. The criteria used for evaluation are own preferences and Jim's requirements.

#### Main insights
* Keyboard friendliness of our application is extremely important. It is useful to distinguish our application from the rest. Keyboard shortcuts must be intuitive, easy to learn and remember.
    * Tab for autocomplete
    * Scroll through command history or task list with up and down
    * Allow users to specify their own shorthand commands so they will remember
    * Summoning the help window with a keyboard shortcut
* Clear visual feedback on the status of the task
    * Overdue and upcoming tasks should stand out
    * Should also be able to see if a task is completed or recurring
    * Identify if the task is selected/has just been updated
* Organized overview of all tasks
    * Tasks should be sorted by their deadline/happening time
    * Users might like to see their recently updated/completed tasks at the top of the list
    * Allow user to see these various types of tasks and distinguish them without having to switch between lists (i.e. have multiple lists)
* Will be nice to allow more details for tasks
    * detailed task descriptions
    * tagging
* Commands should be intuitive and simple enough for new users
    * more natural language like parsing for dates with prepositions as keywords


#### Wunderlist

*Strengths:*

* Clearly displays tasks that have not been completed
* Tasks can be categorized under different lists
* Tasks can have sub tasks
* Possible to highlight tasks by marking as important (starred) or pinning tasks
* Can set deadlines for tasks
* Can create recurring tasks
* Can associate files with tasks
* Can be used offline
* Keyboard friendly – keyboard shortcuts to mark tasks as completed and important
* Search and sort functionality makes finding and organizing tasks easier
* Possible to synchronize across devices
* Give notifications and reminders for tasks near deadline or overdue

*Weaknesses:*

* Wunderlist has a complex interface and might require multiple clicks to get specific tasks done. For example, it has separate field to add tasks, search for tasks and a sort button. There are various lists & sub-lists. Each list has a completed/uncompleted  section and each task needs to be clicked to display the associated subtasks, notes, files and comment.
* New users might not know how to use the advanced features e.g. creating recurring tasks

#### Google calendar

*Strengths:*

* Have a weekly/monthly/daily calendar view which will make it easy for users to visualize their schedules
* Can create recurring events
* Integrated with Gmail. A user can add events from emails easily and this is desirable since Jim's to do items arrive by emails
* Can be used offline
* Possible to synchronize across devices
* Calendar can be exported to CSV/iCal for other users
* CLI to quick add an event to a calendar instead of clicking through the screen
* Comprehensive search by name/details/people involved/location/time


*Weaknesses:*

* Not possible to mark tasks as completed
* Not possible to add tasks without deadline or time
* CLI does not support updating of tasks/deleting etc. Still requires clicking.
* New users might not know of the keyboard shortcuts

### Visual Introduction

Here is what Agendum may look like with some tasks added and completed.

<img src="images/userguide/mainui.png" width="800"><br>

Notice how Agendum has 3 panels: **"Do It Soon"**, **"Do It Anytime"** and **"Done"**.
* **"Do It Soon"** panel will show your **uncompleted** tasks with deadlines and events. Those tasks demand your attention at or by some specific time! Agendum has helpfully sorted these tasks by their deadline or event time.
    * **Overdue** tasks _(e.g. tutorial)_ will stand out in red at the top of the list.
    * **Upcoming** tasks (happening/due within a week) _(e.g. essay draft)_ will stand out in light green next.
* **"Do It Anytime"** panel will show your **uncompleted** tasks which you did not specify a deadline or happening time. Do these tasks anytime.
* **"Done"** panel will show all your completed tasks. To make it easier for you to keep track of what you have done recently, Agendum will always show the latest completed tasks at the top of the list.

Agendum will clearly display the name and time associated with each task. Notice that each task is displayed with a ID. For example, the task *learn piano* has a ID *7* now. We will use this ID to refer to the task for some Agendum commands.

The **Command Box** is located at the top of Agendum. Enter your keyboard commands into the box!
Just in case, there is a **Status Bar** located at the bottom of Agendum. You can check today's date and time, where your Agendum's to-do list data is located and when your data was last saved.

Agendum also has a pretty **Help Window** which summarizes the commands you can use. Agendum might show pop-ups and highlights after each commands for you to review your changes.

### Renaming a task : `rename`

Agendum understands that plans and tasks change all the time. <br>

If you wish to update the description of a task, you can use the following *format*:

* `rename <id> <new name>` - give a new name to the task identified by `<id>`. The `<id>` must be a positive number and be in the most recent to-do list displayed.

Here is an *example*:<br>
<img src="images/userguide/beforeRenaming.png" width="600"><br>

```
Description: I want to be more specific about the movie I want to watch for task id #2.
To update the name of the task,
> rename 2 watch Harry Potter
```

Agendum will promptly update the displayed task list! <br>
<img src="images/userguide/afterRenaming.png" width="600"><br>


### (Re)scheduling a task : `schedule`

Agendum recognizes that your schedule might change, and therefore allows you to reschedule your tasks easily.

Here are the *acceptable format(s)*:

* `schedule <id>` - re-schedule the task identified by `<id>`. It can now be done anytime.  It is no longer bounded by a deadline or event time!
* `schedule <id> by <deadline>` - set or update the deadline for the task identified. Note the keyword `by`.
* `schedule <id> from <start time> to <end time>` - update the start/end time of the task identified by `<id>`. Note the keyword `from` and `to`.

Note:
  > * Again, `<id>` must be a positive number and be in the most recent to-do list displayed.
  > * `<deadline>`, `<start time>` and `<end time>` must follow the format previously defined in [Date Time Format](#date-time-format)
  > * A task cannot have both a deadline and a event time.

Here are some *examples*: <br>
<img src="images/userguide/beforeScheduling.png" width="600"><br>

```
Description: I decide that I can go for a run at any time instead.
> schedule 1
Result: Agendum will start/end time of the task "go for a run" and it will
move to the "Do It Anytime" panel

Description: I want to submit my reflection earlier.
> schedule 2 by tmr 2pm
Result: Agendum will update the deadline of "submit personal reflection". It
will then be sorted in the "Do It Soon" panel.
```

Agendum will promptly update the displayed task list! <br>
<img src="images/userguide/afterScheduling.png" width="600"><br>


### Marking a task as completed : `mark`

Have you completed a task? Well done! <br>
Celebrate the achievement by recording this in Agendum.

Here is the *format*:
* `mark <id>...` - mark all the tasks identified by `<id>`(s) as completed. Each `<id>` must be a positive number and in the most recent to-do list displayed.

```
Description: I just walked my dog!
> mark 4
Result: Agendum will move "walk the dog" to the "Done" panel

Description: I had a really productive day and did all the other tasks too.
> mark 1 2 3
Result: Agendum will save you the hassle of marking each individual task as
completed one by one. It is satisfying to watch how all the tasks move to the
"Done" panel together.

You can also try out any of the following examples:
> mark 1,2,3
> mark 1-3
The tasks with display ids 1, 2 and 3 will be marked as completed.
```

* You can specify a id (e.g. 1) or a range of id (e.g. 3-8). They must be separated by whitespace (e.g. 1 2 3) or commas (e.g. 2,3)

The changes are as shown below.<br>
<img src="images/userguide/marking.png" width="600"><br>


### Unmarking a task : `unmark`

You might change your mind and want to continue working on a recently completed task.
They will conveniently be located at the top of the done panel.

To reflect the change in completion status in Agendum, here is the *format*:
* `unmark <id>...` - unmark all the tasks identified by `<id>`s as completed. Each `<id>` must be a positive number and in the most recent to-do list displayed.

This works in the same way as the `mark` command. The tasks will then be moved to the **"Do It Soon"** or **"Do It Anytime"** panel accordingly. <br>


### Deleting a task : `delete`

We understand that there are some tasks which will never get done and are perhaps no longer relevant. <br>
You can remove these tasks from the task list to keep these tasks out of sight and out of mind.

Here is the *format*:
* `delete <id>...` - delete all the tasks identified by `<id>`s as completed. Each `<id>` must be a positive number and in the most recent to-do list displayed.

Here are some *examples*:<br>
<img src="images/userguide/beforeDeleting.png" width="300"><br>

```
Description: I just walked my dog and no longer want to view this task anymore.
> delete 4
Result: Agendum will delete the task "walk the dog" and it will no longer
appear in any of the 3 panels.

Description: I do not want to view the tasks at all.
> delete 1 2 3
Result: Agendum will save you the hassle of deleting each individual task but
still allows you to selectively choose what to delete.
You can also try out any of the following examples:
> delete 1,2,3
> delete 1-3
The tasks with display ids 1, 2 and 3 will be deleted.
```

* You can specify a id (e.g. 1) or a range of id (e.g. 3-8). They must be separated by whitespace (e.g. 1 2 3) or commas (e.g. 2,3)

The deleted tasks will appear in a popup window. <br>
<img src="images/userguide/afterDeleting.png" width="300"><br>



### Undoing your last changes : `undo`  

Agendum understands that you might make mistakes and change your mind. Hence, Agendum does offer some flexibility and allow you to reverse the effects of a few commands by simply typing `undo`. Multiple and successive `undo` are supported.

Commands that can be "undone" include:
* `add`
* `rename`
* `schedule`
* `mark`
* `unmark`
* `delete`

Although some commands cannot be undone, you can still reverse the effect manually and easily.
* `store` - choose to `store` in your previous location again
* `load` - choose to `load` data from your previous location
* `alias` - `unalias` the shorthand command you just defined
* `unalias` - `alias` the shorthand command you just removed
* `undo` - scroll through your previous commands using the <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> again and enter the command to execute it again
* `list`/`find` - there is only a change in your view but no change in the task data. To go back to the previous view, use <kbd>ESC</kbd>

Examples:
```
> add homework
Result: Agendum adds the task "homework"
> undo
Result: Agendum removes the task "homework"
```
