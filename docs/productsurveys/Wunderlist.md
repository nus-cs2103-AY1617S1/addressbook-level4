# Product survey on Wunderlist.exe

## Introduction

Written in Javascript and PHP, Wunderlist is a task manager application with a
simple, intuitive,and beautiful User Interface that is installed locally on the
hard disk. It has server functions to share todo lists and is able to sync
information using a Wunderlist account. Thus CRUD of local tasks work offline,
but with online, additional syncing, sharing and collaborating features are
accessible.

Throughout this survey, task and to-do mean the same thing.

## CRUD for Tasks

Wunderlist supports the full functionality of Create Read Update Delete of
tasks.

**Creating Tasks**

With the cursor at the To-Do bar, a task can be added by simply typing in the
name and hitting enter. Multiple task can be created with ease with only the
keyboard by repeating the above step. A new task can be created with the
default short-cut keys: Ctrl+N. This brings the cursor to the to do bar without
having to use the mouse.

Setting a due date and starring (highlighting) the task can be done during the
creation of a task. This requires point and click to click on the Set Due Date
and Star task icons.

automatically updated to reflect any changes made to tasks.

Different lists can be created to group task. To create a list, click on +
Create list at the bottom left of the window, or use the default shortcut keys:
Ctrl+Shift+L. The column on the left houses the different lists. User can use
point and click or arrow keys to toggle between the different list. Inbox is
the name of the default list.

**Updating Task**

Wunderlist allows user to add/change the following details of a task after its
creation:

* Task name

* Due date

* Reminder date

* Subtask

* Task notes

* File attachments

To do so, user must select the task, and the editable Task details column will
appear. This can be done by point and click. Task selection can also be done
with the arrow keys, but first the user have to toggle the cursor to a Task.
(For example if the cursor is at the To-do bar, pressing the arrow keys will
not work. User will first have to click on a task). The selected Task is
highlighted Cyan, while the rest will appear white.

For deleting a task, i.e removing a task from the list view, there are two ways
it can be done.

1. 1)Mark as completed, task will then be transferred to completed task list
2. 2)Permanently delete from memory

1) To mark a task as complete, click on the small square box on the task, or
use short cut keys: Ctrl+D (Task must be highlighted cyan first). A
&quot;Ding&quot; will sound  on successful mark completion of a task.
