by passing in commands lines and most of interactions and manipulations can be
done using mouse through the pre-designed user interface. However, in Todoist
there are Keyboard shortcuts provided to users.

#### Positive:

Shortcuts in Todoist help users save time by allowing them to never take their
hands off the keyboard to use the mouse.

Todoist is a half keyboard oriented cross-platform applications, with plenty of
useful keyboard short-cut on both PC and Web clients. It can work both online
or offline on mobile phone or personal computer.

It fully supports creation, reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) function of
floating tasks and deadline-like task. The user interface is well designed and
user can perform their actions quite easily through it. Besides, user can also
conduct simple searching action among all task he or she has created. However,
Todoist also does not support the functionality to add event-like task at all.

Also for premium account, Todoist also gives the support of tracking the task
that has already been done or finished, which gives convenience for user to
record their working history.

Besides, Todoist can automatically suggest how many tasks have already existed
on a certain day when creating the tasks. But since Todoist does not support
event-like task, it also has no support at all for generating suggestion of
suitable time-slots or placing multiple time slots/blocks when creating the
tasks.

Moreover, Todoist does support undo-actions, but only for the last one actions
the user performs.

Furthermore, there are several features that we could learn from Todoist. The
first one is the “Quick-Add” function which enables the user to add either
floating task or deadline task in a single window. The second one is the “Undo”
command, which enables the user to undo the last command immediately when them
perform wrongly.
