#### Adding a Task: `add`
Adds a task into the to-do application. Tasks can be classified into 3 categories: *Floating Tasks* (Tasks with no deadlines), *Deadlines* and *Events*.<br><br>
Format:  

Type | Format  
:-------- | :-------- 
Floating Tasks | `add `**`task_name`**  
Deadlines | `add `**`deadline_name`**` by `**`date`**`[`**`time`**`] [remind `**`date time`**`]`  
Events | `add `**`event_name`**` on `**`date`**`[`**`time`**`] [remind `**`date time`**`]` <br> OR <br> `add `**`event_name`**` from `**`date`**`[`**`time`**`] to ` **`date`**`[`**`time`**`] [remind `**`date time`**`]`  

Examples:
* `add `**`Pay Bills`**

* `add `**`Business Trip`**` from `**`4 Oct`**` to `**`5 Oct`**` remind `**`3 Oct 2pm`**

Note:  
* When entering date and time, the following formats are allowed:
	* 14 Jul, 14 July
	* 9pm, 2100
	* today, tmr

* Words such as **by**, **on**, **from** and **to** are reserved for commands. When adding tasks, if the name consists of any of the reserved words, they should be enclosed within double quotation marks, (" "). For example:
	* add "**Collect equipment from Mary**" **tmr**

* When using reserved words **today** and **tmr**, it is alright to omit the word **on** (applicable for events). For example:
	* add **Club Briefing tmr** &emsp; instead of:&emsp; add **Club Briefing on tmr**
<br><br>	

#### Editing a Task : `edit; reschedule; remind`
Edits a task into the to-do application. There are 3 types of edits possible: *Edit Description*, *Reschedule* and *Remind*.<br><br>
Format:

Type | Format

Edit Description | `edit `**`task_number new_task_name`**  
Reschedule | `reschedule `**`task_number`**` to `**`date`**`[`**`time`**`] [remind `**`date time`**`]`  
Remind | `remind `**`task_number`**` on `**`date time`**

Examples:
* `edit `**`3 Pass money to Abel`**
* `reschedule `**`Submit proposal `**` to `**`13 Oct 5pm`**
* `remind `**`1 3 Oct 2pm`**

Note:
* Only one reminder is supported for each task. The date and time specified in the "Remind" command will replace any existing reminder. To remove a reminder completely, you will have to type "**null**" after typing the task number. For example:
