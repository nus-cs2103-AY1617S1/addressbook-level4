## Introduction
With many deadlines and tasks streaming in, you can be easily overwhelmed if you are not able to keep track of them effectively. While traditional task managers require you to interact through a graphical user interface, our task manager allows you to manage your tasks quickly through keyboard commands.

With our task manager, you can add, delete and edit tasks without a fuss. Through the usage of shortcuts, you will be able to enter your desired commands quickly. Best of all, it works with Google Calendar so any changes that you have made on either platform will be synchronized. Managing tasks has never been such a breeze.

<br>
## Quick Start

0. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.<br>
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>

1. Download the latest `taskmanager.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Task Manager.
3. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

4. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. <br>
   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window.
5. Some example commands you can try:
   * **`help`** : lists all commands
   * **`add`**` Meeting, July 10, 5pm-6pm` :
     adds a `Meeting` task on `July 10, 5pm-6pm` to the Task Manager
   * **`alias`**` am add Meeting` : `am` is now a shortcut for `add Meeting`
