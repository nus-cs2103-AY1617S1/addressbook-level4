We are a team based in the [School of Computing, National University of Singapore](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg), doing this project for our [CS2103](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1617S1/) module. We hope this app proves to be useful for people and that this app's scope is not limited solely to our module project.
