* This is a desktop Task Scheduler application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using 
  a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java application intended for workplace businessmen who are looking for a convenient way to track
  and manage their tasks. 
* Users need only key in their command, tasks and/or deadline in one line. Features include add, delete, undo
  and many more!
