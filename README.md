# TaSc

<img src="docs/images/Ui.png" width="600"><br>

* TaSc (pronounced '*tas*', without the '*k*'), is a desktop task list application. The name comes from the initials of **ta**sk **sc**heduler.
* It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
    * It provides a list of commands, suitable for keyboard users, in order to manage the tasks in the task list.
    * It provides a GUI interface (with list and browser) so as to get a visual feedback of the task list for easier management.
* It is written using the Java programming language.
* For developers, it has support for *Build Automation* using Gradle and for *Continuous Integration* using Travis CI.

#### Target Audience
Jim is a heavy keyboard user.

Jim chances upon TaSc, a program that allows him to manage his task list by typing commands,
instead of having to use the mouse.

Jim uses the GUI mainly to see the result of the commands that he executed, but does not click 
on the interface. The keyboard is his main tool.

Jim wants to be able to work offline, and be able to follow the [Inbox Zero](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/inbox-zero)
workflow.
