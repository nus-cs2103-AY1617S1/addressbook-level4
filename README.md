# Address Book (Level 4)

<img src="docs/images/Ui.png" width="600"><br>

* This is a desktop Task Manager application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using 
  a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application intended for users who prefer to keep their email inbox clean and assign any 
  todo items somewhere else. 
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code example that is 
  **significantly bigger** (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules. 
* What's different from Google Calender:
    * A desktop software that can be summoned quickly.
    * Good in capturing tasks that need to be done before a specific date/time, or after a specific date/time, and items without specific times.
    * Uses one shot command input rather than several clicks.
    * Works without internet connections.
