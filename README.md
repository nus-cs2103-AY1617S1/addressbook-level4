* This is a desktop Task Manager application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using 
  a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* The base code is taken from [Address Book (level 4)](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1617S1/addressbook-level4). Below are some         description about Address Book (level 4):
  * It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as 
    the main programming language. 
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code example that is 
    **significantly bigger** (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
