* Amethyst is a desktop task manager application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using 
  a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application intended for users who prefer to keep their email inbox clean and assign any 
  todo items somewhere else.  
* What's different from Google Calendar:
    * A desktop software that can be summoned quickly.
    * Good in capturing tasks that need to be done before a specific date/time, or after a specific date/time, and items without specific times.
    * Uses one shot command input rather than several clicks.
    * Works without internet connection.
