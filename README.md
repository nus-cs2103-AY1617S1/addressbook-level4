{Application will look similar to the above. Will be updated in the future}

* This is a desktop Task/Event Manager application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using 
  a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* A sample Java application was given to us. Below are some of the comments on the sample application:
 * It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as 
  the main programming language. 
 * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code example that is 
  **significantly bigger** (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
