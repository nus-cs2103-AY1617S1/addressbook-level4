Have you ever missed a deadline because you did not write it down?

Don't worry! WhatNow will help you to remember your schedule and todos so that you will never miss a deadline or forget anything! It is a desktop application which allows you to store, retrieve and update your schedule and todos. All you need to do is to type a command and the output will be displayed in a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

It is intended for users who can type fast, spend most of the time near a computer, and prefer typing over mouse/voice commands.
