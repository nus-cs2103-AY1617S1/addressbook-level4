* This is a desktop Task Manager application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using 
  a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* Our product is a to-do list that accepts natural language commands via keyboard. The product is specifically 	catered towards users who   spend prolonged durations in front of the computer and prefer using solely the keyboard. On top of all these, the product is fully         functional offline with a variety of commands provided in the user guide which are easily understood.
