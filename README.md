* This is a desktop to do list application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using
  a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is an application intended for users to put their tasks into a scheduling system.
* It uses Java as the main programming language. 
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code example that is
  **significantly bigger** (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
