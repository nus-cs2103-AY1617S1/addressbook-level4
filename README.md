<img src="docs/images/UI_Prototype/WhatNowUI-Welcome-Colour.png" width="600"><br>

Have you ever missed a deadline because you had forgotten to write it down? Have you ever missed out on something that you have?

Don't worry! WhatNow will help you to remember your schedule and todos so that you will never miss a deadline or forget anything! It is a desktop application which allows you to store, retrieve and update your schedule and todos. All you need to do is to type a command and the output will be displayed in a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

It is intended for users who can type fast, spend most of the time near a computer, and prefer typing over mouse/voice commands.
